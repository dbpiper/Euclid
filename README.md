I have chosen to use Tern.js to provide type information to the project
rather than using TypeScript (which was the original plan). This
was based on reading [Eric Elliott's opinions on the topic](https://medium.com/@_ericelliott/yep-i-suspect-a-large-number-of-converts-are-just-beginning-to-wake-up-to-the-typescript-hangover-978d1708e36e)
essentially that TypeScript has a lot of drawbacks and a high cost relative
to its benefits and that you can get many of the same benefits without
the cost by using Tern.js. He talked about this in [You Might Not Need TypeScript (or Static Types)](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/you-might-not-need-typescript-or-static-types-aa7cb670a77b)
a few years ago also.
